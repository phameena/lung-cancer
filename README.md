Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates and improve patient outcomes. While numerous diagnostic methods are available, many rely on complex procedures and subjective assessments that depend on the expertise of medical professionals. To address these challenges, this study leverages computational techniques to predict the likelihood of lung cancer development based on an individual's habits and current health status.The proposed approach utilizes a systematic analysis of key health indicators and lifestyle factors to provide an accurate and efficient diagnostic prediction. This method significantly reduces the complexity and time associated with traditional diagnostic techniques. The project is deployed using a Django-based framework, ensuring accessibility and scalability. By automating the prediction process, this system aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying high-risk cases early, paving the way for timely medical interventions."
